# Todo List App

A simple application to keep track of all of our todos which are getting store in our local storage till we clear them all out. We have the ability to rename our todos and mark them as complete.

As I am not a designer the design is highly influenced by this [codepen](https://codepen.io/saawsan/pen/jayzeq).

The website is deployed [here](https://aesthetictodolist.netlify.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
